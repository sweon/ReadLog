**ReadLog** is a lightweight, private, and local-only book reading progress tracker. It helps you stay focused on your reading goals without worrying about your data being shared or stored on any external servers.

Everything you record—your books, your reading sessions, and your progress—is stored directly in your browser's local database (IndexedDB).

## ✨ Features

- **📚 Essential Reading Tracking**: Easily add books and track your progress by recording the pages you've read in each session.
- **📊 Progress Visualization**: 
  - Visual charts showing **Cumulative Progress**.
  - Automatic calculation of completion percentage.
- **🔄 Private Device Sync**: Synchronize your data between multiple devices (e.g., PC and Mobile). 
  - **End-to-End Encrypted**: Data is encrypted using AES-GCM before leaving your device.
  - **Relay Signaling**: Seamless connection using Room IDs or QR Codes (no account required).
  - **Automatic Bidirectional Sync**: One device scans and both devices stay updated.
- **📂 Data Management**:
  - Export your entire library or specific books to a JSON file for backup.
  - Import data from backups to restore your history.
  - Factory reset option to wipe all local data when needed.
- **🌓 Modern UI/UX**:
  - **Dark/Light Mode** support.
  - **Customizable Font Size** for better readability.
  - **Responsive Design** with a resizable sidebar and mobile-optimized views.
- **📱 PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Install ReadLog as an app on your device for quick access and offline use.
- **🌐 Multi-language Support**: Fully localized in **English** and **Korean**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: Dexie.js (IndexedDB wrapper)
- **Synchronization**: AES-GCM Encryption + Relay Signaling (via ntfy & tmpfiles)
- **Visuals**: Recharts (Progress charts), QR Code (Easy sync)
- **Icons**: Emoji-based and CSS-styled icons
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with modern features (CSS Variables, Flexbox/Grid)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS recommended)

## 🔒 Privacy

ReadLog is designed with privacy as the top priority:
- **No Cloud Storage**: Your data is stored locally on your device. No accounts or central servers are used to save your reading history.
- **End-to-End Encrypted Sync**: When syncing between devices, your library is encrypted locally using **AES-GCM** with a PIN you control. The data remains encrypted during transit and is only decrypted on your other device.
- **Privacy-First Signaling**: Synchronization uses a temporary relay for connection, but your readable data is never stored on any intermediate server.
